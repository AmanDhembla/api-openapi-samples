    Etag:
      name: Etag
      description: |
        The RFC7232 ETag header field in a response provides the current entity-
        tag for the selected resource. An entity-tag is an opaque identifier for
        different versions of a resource over time, regardless whether multiple
        versions are valid at the same time. An entity-tag consists of an opaque
        quoted string, possibly prefixed by a weakness indicator.
      in: header
      example: W/"xy", "5", "7da7a728-f910-11e6-942a-68f728c1ba70"
      required: false
      type: string
    IfMatch:
      name: If-Match
      description: |
        The RFC7232 If-Match header field in a request requires the server to
        only operate on the resource that matches at least one of the provided
        entity-tags. This allows clients express a precondition that prevent
        the method from being applied if there have been any changes to the
        resource.
      in: header
      required: false
      example: '"5", "7da7a728-f910-11e6-942a-68f728c1ba70"'
      type: string
    IfNoneMatch:
      name: If-None-Match
      description: |
        The RFC7232 If-None-Match header field in a request requires the server
        to only operate on the resource if it does not match any of the provided
        entity-tags. If the provided entity-tag is `*`, it is required that the
        resource does not exist at all.
      in: header
      required: false
      example: '"7da7a728-f910-11e6-942a-68f728c1ba70", *'
